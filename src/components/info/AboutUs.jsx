            FocusJuju was born from a simple observation: working alongside someone else makes it easier to focus. 
            We've reimagined this concept of "body doubling" for the digital age, creating an AI companion that provides 
            the benefits of accountability without the social pressure.

            Our Story
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            FocusJuju began in 2023 when our founder, Alex, was struggling with her ADHD diagnosis and finding it 
            difficult to stay focused while working remotely. Traditional productivity apps weren't cutting it - they 
            were either too rigid or lacked the human element that made body doubling so effective.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Partnering with neurodiversity experts and developers, Alex set out to create a tool that would provide 
            the benefits of body doubling in a supportive, non-judgmental way. The goal was to create an experience 
            that felt like working with a supportive friend rather than a sterile productivity app.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Today, FocusJuju is helping thousands of people with ADHD, anxiety, and other focus challenges to be more 
            productive without the stress of traditional productivity methods.

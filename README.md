## üåü Overview

HelloJuju is an AI-powered accountability buddy designed to help you stay focused and productive. Drawing inspiration from the concept of "body doubling" (working alongside someone to maintain focus), HelloJuju creates a supportive, virtual presence that adapts to your mood and needs.

### üß† Key Features

- **AI Body Doubling**: Work alongside a friendly AI companion that provides gentle encouragement
- **Mood-Responsive Support**: The AI adapts its approach based on how you're feeling
- **Micro-Goal Setting**: Break overwhelming tasks into manageable chunks
- **Flexible Focus Sessions**: Choose from different session types based on your energy level
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your achievements with non-intimidating visualizations
- **Weekend Mode**: Different support patterns for workdays vs. weekends
